# 🚀 Announcing OptiScaler Universal v0.1.0-alpha

## TL;DR
Automated tool that detects your GPU and optimizes OptiScaler settings for maximum performance on Linux. Get 50-80% FPS boost with near-DLSS quality on AMD GPUs.

---

## 🎯 What Is It?

**OptiScaler Universal** is an intelligent installer that automatically configures [OptiScaler](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler) for your specific GPU and games, bringing FSR4, XeSS, and enhanced upscaling to Linux gaming.

### The Problem
- Manual OptiScaler configuration is complex
- Settings vary dramatically between GPU architectures
- No easy way to know optimal settings for your hardware
- Time-consuming trial and error

### The Solution
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ind4skylivey/0ptiscaler4linux.git
cd 0ptiscaler4linux
bash scripts/install.sh
```

That's it! The tool:
1. ✅ Detects your GPU (AMD/Intel/NVIDIA)
2. ✅ Scans your Steam library
3. ✅ Shows compatible games
4. ✅ Generates optimized configs
5. ✅ Provides clear instructions
