  notes: |
    Intel Arc has excellent XeSS native performance and quality.
    XeSS on Arc often matches or exceeds DLSS quality.
    RT performance is moderate, good for 1080p/1440p.

recommendations:
  ingame_upscaling: "XeSS Quality (or DLSS Quality)"
  ingame_reflex: "Off (not supported)"
  ingame_vsync: false
  quality_preset: "High to Ultra"
  ray_tracing: "Medium (1080p/1440p)"
  
troubleshooting:
  common_issues:
    - issue: "XeSS not appearing"
      solution: "Ensure latest Mesa drivers and proper spoofing"
    - issue: "Lower FPS than expected"
      solution: "Disable RT or reduce quality preset"
