  notes: |
    NVIDIA RTX GPUs have native DLSS and Reflex support.
    OptiScaler is optional and mainly useful for:
    - Experimenting with FSR/XeSS
    - Games without native DLSS
    - Comparing upscalers
    
    For best results: Use native DLSS instead of OptiScaler.

recommendations:
  ingame_upscaling: "Native DLSS Quality"
  ingame_reflex: "On + Boost"
  ingame_vsync: false
  quality_preset: "Ultra with Ray Tracing"
  ray_tracing: "Highly recommended"
  frame_generation: "Available on RTX 40 series"
  
notes: |
  OptiScaler on NVIDIA is primarily for experimentation.
  
  Use OptiScaler if:
  - You want to test FSR4 vs DLSS
  - Game lacks native DLSS
  - You're curious about XeSS
  
  Don't use OptiScaler if:
  - Game has native DLSS 3+ (use that instead)
  - You want Frame Generation (use native DLSS 3)
  - You prioritize absolute best quality
