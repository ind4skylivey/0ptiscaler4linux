performance_notes: |
  Alan Wake 2 is EXTREMELY demanding, especially with path tracing.
  DLSS Performance or Ultra Performance recommended for PT mode.
  Game has excellent DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction.
  Medium preset still looks amazing with upscaling.

gpu_specific_notes:
  rdna4:
    notes: "Can handle path tracing at 1440p with DLSS Performance."
    recommended_preset: "High or Path Tracing Low"
  rdna3:
    notes: "High preset without PT, or Medium with PT."
    recommended_preset: "High (no PT)"
  rdna2:
    notes: "Medium-High recommended, avoid path tracing."
    recommended_preset: "Medium"

troubleshooting:
  common_issues:
    - issue: "Extremely low FPS"
      solution: "This game is brutally demanding. Use Medium preset and DLSS Balanced/Performance"
    - issue: "Stuttering"
      solution: "Shader compilation - normal on first run. Disable RT/PT if persistent"
