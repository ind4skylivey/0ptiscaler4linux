performance_notes: |
  Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the most demanding games but scales excellently
  with OptiScaler + FSR4. The game has native DLSS 3.5 with Ray Reconstruction.
  
  Key recommendations:
  - Use DLSS Quality for best balance (OptiScaler intercepts this)
  - Enable Ray Tracing for the intended experience
  - Path Tracing requires high-end GPU (RDNA3+ or RTX 40 series)
  - Motion blur should be off to avoid conflicts
  - Anti-Lag 2 significantly improves responsiveness in combat

gpu_specific_notes:
  rdna4:
    notes: "Excellent performance with FSR4. Path tracing playable at 1440p with DLSS Performance."
    recommended_preset: "Ray Tracing: Ultra with Path Tracing"
  
  rdna3:
    notes: "Great RT performance. FSR3.1 with DLSS inputs provides excellent quality."
    recommended_preset: "Ray Tracing: Ultra"
  
  rdna2:
    notes: "Good performance. RT Medium recommended for 60+ FPS."
    recommended_preset: "Ray Tracing: Medium"
  
  arc:
    notes: "XeSS native works well. RT performance moderate."
    recommended_preset: "Ray Tracing: Medium or High (no RT)"
  
  nvidia_rtx40:
    notes: "Use native DLSS 3.5 with Frame Generation for best results."
    recommended_preset: "Native DLSS (OptiScaler optional)"

troubleshooting:
  common_issues:
    - issue: "DLSS not appearing in menu"
      solution: "Verify WINEDLLOVERRIDES in Steam launch options"
      
    - issue: "Game crashes on startup"
      solution: "Try Proton GE-Proton 9-11 or newer, ensure dxgi.dll has correct permissions"
      
    - issue: "Flickering or ghosting"
      solution: "Disable motion sharpness in OptiScaler.ini"
      
    - issue: "Low FPS with RT"
      solution: "Reduce RT preset to Medium or disable. Try DLSS Balanced/Performance"
      
    - issue: "Input lag feels high"
      solution: "Ensure Reflex is On + Boost, check fakenvapi is working"
      
    - issue: "Over-sharpened image"
      solution: "Reduce sharpness to 0.2 or 0.3 in OptiScaler.ini"

user_guide: |
  INSTALLATION:
  1. Install OptiScaler using the universal installer
  2. Configure Steam launch options (critical!)
  3. Launch game and go to Graphics settings
  4. Set DLSS to Quality or Balanced
  5. Enable NVIDIA Reflex: On + Boost
  6. Set Ray Tracing to your preferred level
  7. Disable Motion Blur for best results
  
  VERIFICATION:
  - Press HOME in-game to see OptiScaler menu
  - Check that FSR3.1/FSR4 is active
  - Press ALT+SHIFT+L to verify Anti-Lag 2
  - Monitor FPS - should see 50-80% improvement
  
  OPTIMIZATION:
  - If FPS < 60: Reduce RT preset or use DLSS Balanced
  - If image too sharp: Reduce sharpness in OptiScaler.ini
  - If stuttering: Close background apps, check VRAM usage
  - For max quality: Use DLSS Quality with RT Ultra
