performance_notes: |
  New World scales excellently with OptiScaler + FSR4.
  The game uses NVIDIA Streamline for DLSS implementation.
  
  Key recommendations:
  - DLSS Quality provides best balance
  - Anti-Lag 2 significantly improves responsiveness in PvP
  - Game is CPU-bound in towns, GPU-bound in wilderness
  - Medium shadows can give big FPS boost
