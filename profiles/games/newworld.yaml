performance_notes: |
  New World scales excellently with OptiScaler + FSR4.
  The game uses NVIDIA Streamline for DLSS implementation.

  Key recommendations:
  - DLSS Quality provides best balance
  - Anti-Lag 2 significantly improves responsiveness in PvP
  - Game is CPU-bound in towns, GPU-bound in wilderness
  - Medium shadows can give big FPS boost

    recommended_preset: "Very High"

  rdna3:
    notes: "Great performance. FSR3.1 with DLSS inputs works excellently."
    recommended_preset: "High to Very High"

  rdna2:
    notes: "Good performance. Stick to High preset for 60+ FPS."
